**[📄[arXiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.02921)**

> 📌 PyTorch implementation of the EDSR model described in **"Enhanced Deep Residual Networks for Single Image Super-Resolution" (CVPR Workshops 2017)**.  
> **Type:** Personal project  
> **Goal:** Reproduce the EDSR architecture for educational and experimental purposes.

This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of the EDSR model, which aims to reconstruct high-resolution images from their low-resolution counterparts. The EDSR architecture removes unnecessary modules from conventional residual networks and expands the model size to achieve superior performance in single image super-resolution tasks.
